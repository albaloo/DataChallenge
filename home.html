<h2>Results</h2>
</br>
I've analyzed Amazon Reviews of Baby Products to answer two questions:
<ul>
<li><b>Q1.</b> Are there any relationship between length of the reviews and the helpfulness scores given by users?</li>
<li><b>Q2.</b> Are there any relationship between review scores and the helpfulness scores given by users?</li>
</ul>
In order to find out which features are affecting the helpfulness score, we can perform a regression analysis and find out whether length of the reviews or review scores can predict helpfulness.
However, for the purpose of this challenge and because I was asked to deliver plots, I've decided to answer the above two questions by inspecting some graphs.
The visual inspection is usually the first step in a complete data analysis process, but it should be enough to demonstrate my skills for the purpose of this challenge.
<br />
<br />
<h3>Q1</h3>
Helpfulness score in amazon reviews consists of two numbers [x, y], where x is the number of people who found the review helpful and y is the total number of people who voted for helpfulness or unhelpfulness of the review.
Let's first compute a helpfulness percentage by dividing x/y. Then we need to compute the length of the review (excluding stop words and punctuations).
Now we can plot the helpfulness percentage on the y axis and review length on the x axis as shown below.
<div><img class="plot" src="plot1.png" alt="helpfulness-length" /></div>
<br />
It looks like that when the length of the review is between 1 to 7, there is not much variety between the helpfulness scores.
Now let's compare average helpfulness percentage for each length.
<div><img class="plot" src="plot2.png" alt="helpfulness-length" /></div>
<br />
Again, it looks like there is not much difference in average helpfulness percentage for each length (other than two data points). Therefore, visually we did not find any indication that helpfulness percentage and length of review are related.
<br />
<br />
<h3>Q2</h3>
Now let's plot the helpfulness percentage on the y axis and overall review score on the x axis as shown below.
<div><img class="plot" src="plot3.png" alt="helpfulness-length" /></div>
<br />
There are so many data points and visually there is not much variety in the helpfulness scores for each overall review score.
Now let's compare average helpfulness percentage for each overall score.
<div><img class="plot" src="plot4.png" alt="helpfulness-length" /></div>
<br />
Interestingly as overall score increases more people find reviews helpful on average. But, more analysis needs to be done to find out if this increase is significant.
